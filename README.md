# Fast Penguin - Wikipedia Search

This project provides tools to upload data (likely Wikipedia content) to a Turbopuffer vector database and a Svelte-based frontend to search through that data.

## Components

*   **Data Upload Scripts (`.py`)**: Python scripts (`upload_simple.py`, `upload_to_turbopuffer.py`) designed to process and upload data to Turbopuffer.
*   **Search Frontend (`wiki-search-frontend/`)**: A SvelteKit application providing a user interface to query the data stored in Turbopuffer.
